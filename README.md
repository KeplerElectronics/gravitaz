This project was developed in Pico-8, and as such, is similar to Lua, but will not be perfectly portable. The .p8 file includes the whole project, including the graphics at the end. This repo exists to allow those without access to Pico-8 to still read and access the code and learn from it. Feel free to take whatever, including for commercial purposes, but please make changes and don't simply resell this work.
